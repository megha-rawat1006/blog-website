                        <a href="#" class="blog-title">What is Virtual Reality?</a>
                        <p>
                            Virtual reality as the name suggests itself is something that is near enough (virtual) actuality (reality).Virtual reality is the use of software and computer technology to create a simulated (artificial) environment. It places the user inside an environment which is virtual but user belief and accepts it as real.
                            In its simplest form, virtual reality is simulating vision of the user, it includes creating an immersive 3D (computer created) world that you can explore and feel as if you are really there both mentally and physically. Humans react more quickly to audios than to visuals. Therefore, in order to create more convincing VR applications it requires more than just graphics. To create more immersive VR experiences accurate sound effects are must. Sound effects synced with visuals can create more attractive effects.
                            Let’s check some devices needed for Virtual Reality.
                            In order to provide power to interactive three dimensional virtual environment computing power is required and it is done by the help of PC/Console/Smartphone. They are like the engine  that provide power.
                            Head Mounted Displays(HMDs) is just what it sounds like is a small computer display worn on the head. It is meant for total immersion of the user and ensures that no matter in which direction user’s head may turn the display is positioned right in front of the user’s eyes or whatever HMD is displaying is always on the field view of the user. In other words it presents visuals to your peripheral vision. It is commonly referred as ‘Virtual reality headset’ or ‘Virtual reality glasses’.

                        <p>
                            Manners mean having polite or well-bred social behaviour by the people. The words and behaviour of a good mannered person never change and remain the same in all conditions. They know very well how to show or tell the bitter truth with sweet words. There is a well-known idiom, what goes around comes around, therefore, people should treat others as they wish to be treated themselves. Manners are something used every day to make a good impression on others and to feel good about oneself.

                            It matters a lot to have good manners for living a social life. In other words, we can say that manners are "necessary" for acceptability in society. We cannot get success in anything important, whether it is in personal or business world, without manners. Good manners are "ornamental", it means it does not necessarily deal with what one says or the deeds one tries to perform rather they deal with how the words are said and how the deeds are done. It is important to have the ability to express ideas clearly and politely.

                            It is important to teach good manners to all the student as they are future of the country. Lack of manners among youth leads them at the wrong path. Practising good manners cost nothing but pay us a lot throughout life. As a well-mannered person, we set a standard for others too which encourage them to practice good manner and behave well. It is not easy for everyone to follow good manners but can become easy after practising well. Good manners make a person pleasing and obeying which is appreciated and genuinely loved by all in society.
